# 🧠 Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) – Exploratory Analysis & Clustering

This project demonstrates how **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** can be used for unsupervised clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. It provides a practical implementation of SOMs using MiniSom and includes data preprocessing, SOM training, visualizations, and cluster interpretation.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📊 Data Preprocessing for normalization and dimensionality compatibility  
- 🧩 Implementation of **MiniSom** to train a Self-Organizing Map  
- 🌐 Visualization of distance maps (U-Matrix) for understanding neighborhood clustering  
- 🔍 Cluster interpretation with heatmaps and component planes  
- ✅ Final label assignment based on the trained SOM
