# Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) – Exploratory Analysis & Clustering

This project demonstrates how **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** can be used for unsupervised clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. It provides a practical implementation of SOMs using MiniSom and includes data preprocessing, SOM training, visualizations, and cluster interpretation.

## Project Highlights

- Data Preprocessing for normalization and dimensionality compatibility  
- Implementation of **MiniSom** to train a Self-Organizing Map  
- Visualization of distance maps (U-Matrix) for understanding neighborhood clustering  
- Cluster interpretation with heatmaps and component planes  
- Final label assignment based on the trained SOM
